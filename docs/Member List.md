## Xingyu Pan

### üõ† Skills
- **Programming**:  
  C, Python (my best pal), PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO (the model, not the lifestyle!)
- **Computer Vision**:  
  Object Detection (I see you üëÄ), Image Segmentation, Small Object Detection (yes, even tiny things matter!)

### üß≥ Experiences
- **Intern at Machine Vision Company**  
  Spent hours staring at surveillance video feeds, working on real-time object detection. Yes, my eyes still work!
- **YOLO Master**  
  Applied deep learning models (YOLO) to boost detection accuracy in challenging environments. Picture me saying, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt mean *that* YOLO!‚Äù
