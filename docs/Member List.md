### 🛠 Skills
- **Programming**:  
  C, Python (my best pal), PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO (the model, not the lifestyle!)
- **Computer Vision**:  
  Object Detection (I see you 👀), Image Segmentation, Small Object Detection (yes, even tiny things matter!)
- **Machine Learning**:  
  Deep Learning (sleep? what's that?), Neural Networks, Scikit-learn (gotta keep it light with `sklearn`)
- **Natural Language Processing**:  
  Knowledge Graph (connecting the dots), NLP Techniques (making computers understand us, sorta)

### 🧳 Experiences
- **Intern at Machine Vision Company**  
  Spent hours staring at surveillance video feeds, working on real-time object detection. Yes, my eyes still work!
- **YOLO Master**  
  Applied deep learning models (YOLO) to boost detection accuracy in challenging environments. Picture me saying, “No, I don’t mean *that* YOLO!”
- **Small Object Detection Researcher**  
  Dedicated to finding tiny details in low-res, cluttered images. A challenge? Sure, but the small things add up!
- **NLP & Knowledge Graphs Enthusiast**  
  Co-authored a paper titled *"Research on Highway Engineering Safety Management System Based on Knowledge Graph"*. Yes, it’s as niche as it sounds, and yes, it's super cool.
